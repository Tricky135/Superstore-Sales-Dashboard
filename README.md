# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
This project is an advanced dashboard of Superstore Sales Analysis.

This dashboard project has been created using MS Excel. This is an advanced sales analysis dashboard featuring a superstore for the years 2014-2017 comparing its profits, sales, transactions and contributions over the duration. Utilization of slicers, pivot tables and charts makes the data more visually appealing and displays specific results based on the user needs. An image of the dashboard has also been added in this repository for an overview. The preprocessing and designing of this dashboard was done on the "SuperStore Data.xlsx" dataset.
